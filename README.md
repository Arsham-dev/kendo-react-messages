## Overview

This repository contains translated messages for Kendo UI components for React.

## Basic Usage

To load the messages and associate them with a specific language, utilize the [`loadMessages`](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-react-ui/components/globalization/api/loadMessages/) method that is exported by the Internationalization package. The messages can be either in the form of a JSON file or as an iterable key-value collection.
